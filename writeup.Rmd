# Insomnia: Indicators and Associations in Self-reported Data

## Introduction

One of the most common conditions that affects sleep is characterized by
its untimely absence. Insomnia affects anywhere from 6-30% of
individuals worldwide, depending on varying criteria for frequency,
intensity, and duration of sleeplessness
[[1](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.26929)]. There are also many
explanations for insomnia, ranging from lifestyle and stress to genetics
and developmental experiences
[[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8506741/pdf/atm-09-18-1426.pdf),[3](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00046.2019)].
One aspect of insomnia that is ubiquitous, however, is its association
with anxiety and depression
[[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8506741/pdf/atm-09-18-1426.pdf)].

Individuals interested in "decoding" insomnia and other chronic
conditions can download the Flaredown app and record a variety of
trackables (diagnoses, symptoms, behaviors, even the weather!)
[[4](https://flaredown.com/)]. To help with this endeavor, we can use
the entirety of user data generated over seven years and begin
hypothesis generation.

## Data and Direction

Despite Flaredown not being designed specifically for insomnia or sleep
study, the presence of insomnia-tagged data is quite common in this
dataset. The accuracy of such diagnoses cannot be so easily verified,
given that these data are self-reported. There is nevertheless much to
explore.

Lets start by determining the most common tags reported on the days
users reported insomnia:

Now, these tags are most likely appearing not because they are
associated with insomnia, but simply because they are common data
points. If they are related, however, we can be confident that our
sample size will be large enough to detect the true relationship.

## Predicting Insomnia from Weather Conditions

Weather is the most prominent tag, and it happens to have the most
granular data in the whole set; weather is measured by five continuous
variables: pressure, humidity, minimum temperature, maximum temperature,
and precipitation intensity.

If we perform principal component analysis on all weather data
regardless of insomnia status, we see that the first two components are
sufficient representations of data, and we can thus get an idea of the
sample space from a scatter of these components:

![](./figures/figure_pca.png){width=".9\\linewidth"}

There does not appear to be much natural clustering in the first two
components, but perhaps by performing k-means clustering on all five
components, we will be able to identify a meaningful clustering that
even has some accuracy in partitioning days with insomnia from days
without insomnia:

![](./figures/figure_insomnia_cluster.png){width=".9\\linewidth"}

Ouch! With an NMI like that, we can safely conclude that our k-means
clustering has no predictive power with regard to insomnia status. In
fact, this score means that our clustering is only microscopically
better at predicting insomia status than if one were to assign clusters
at random.

While this holds for our full sample space, it may be informative to
instead consider a subset of the data. Note that for data where PC1 \<
-50, it seems that cases of insomnia rarely appear above PC2 = -40.
Let's try k-means clustering again, on the subset of these two
components:

![](./figures/figure_insomnia_cluster_subset.png){width=".9\\linewidth"}

Ouch! The clustering appears to have detected something this time, but
the NMI still will not budge. If we were to use the current clustering
as a predictor for insomnia, we would observe a very high false positive
rate.

As a final appeal, we can use multiple logistic regression to elucidate
a relationship between insomnia status and the five weather metrics. If
we create a logistic model with insomnia status as the response variable
and the first two principal components as predictor variables, we get
the following result:

![](./figures/figure_logistic.png){width=".9\\linewidth"}

Despite the low p-values with respect to each principal component, the
clinical significance of the detected relationship is insignificant.
This is evident in the flatness of the prediction surface.

## Future Direction

After the above analysis, it is safe to say that this dataset does not
indicate the presence of a meaningful relationship between insomnia
status and pressure, humidity, minimum temperature, maximum temperature,
or precipitation intensity.

There is still much to explore in this data, however, but future
investigation should utilize existing insomnia literature for direction.
For example, it is known that insomnia is influenced by other sleep
disorders, lack of physical activity, medication use, and chronic
pain--all of which have associations with aging
[[5](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355167),[6](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/insomnia/causes)].
We have the data to test each of these associations, but these endeavors
may require additional data wrangling, as much of this data does not
exist in continuous numeric form. To preview the challenges that will
enmesh future study, consider how many data points exist for each unique
user:

![](./figures/figure_days_per_user.png){width=".9\\linewidth"}

For occurrence and count derivations, such a distribution will
necessitate various controls.

#### While the project did not reveal any clinical insights, this exercise in data science has been an exposition of the various tools that can be leveraged to manipulate and classify large-scale user-generated data.
